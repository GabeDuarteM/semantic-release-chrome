## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm][npm] which is bundled with [node][node] and
should be installed as one of your project's `devDependencies`:

```bash
npm install --save-dev semantic-release-chrome
```

## Description

This package provides a set of [`semantic-release`][semantic-release] plugins for you to easily publish Chrome extensions automatically.
Besides creating a release on the Chrome webstore, it also writes the correct version to the `manifest.json` and creates a zip file containing everything inside the dist folder, so you can use the official `@semantic-release/github` plugin and upload the release to the GitHub releases page, so your users can easily rollback to an earlier version if a newer one introduces a bad bug.

## Usage

This package export the following plugins:

### `verifyConditions`

Verify the presence of the authentication parameters, which are set via environment variables (see [Chrome webstore authentication][chrome-authentication]).

#### `verifyConditions` parameters

- `extensionId`: **REQUIRED** parameter. The `extension id` from the webstore. For example: If the url of your extension is [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webplayer-hotkeys-shortcu/ikmkicnmahfdilneilgibeppbnolgkaf](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webplayer-hotkeys-shortcu/ikmkicnmahfdilneilgibeppbnolgkaf), then the last portion, `ikmkicnmahfdilneilgibeppbnolgkaf`, will be the `extension id`. You can also take this ID on the [developers dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard), under the name `Item ID` located inside the `More info` dialog. This is used so that we can confirm that the credentials are working for the extension you are trying to publish.

### `prepare`

Writes the correct version to the `manifest.json` and creates a `zip` file with everything inside the `dist` folder.

This plugin requires some parameters to be set, so be sure to check below and fill them accordingly.

#### `prepare` parameters

- `asset`: **REQUIRED** parameter. The filename of the zip file.

- `distFolder`: The folder that will be zipped. Defaults to `dist`.

- `manifestPath`: The path of the `manifest.json` file inside the dist folder. Defaults to `<distFolder parameter>/manifest.json`.

The `asset` parameter is parsed with Lodash template. The following variables are available: `branch`, `lastRelease`, `nextRelease` and `commits`. Search on the [plugins](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/developer-guide/plugin.md) documentation to see the type of those objects.

Example: `my-extension_v${nextRelease.version}_${branch.name}.zip` will result in something like `my-extension_v2.3.1_main.zip`

### `publish`

Uploads the generated zip file to the webstore and publishes a new release.

Unfortunately, due to Google's restrictions, this plugin can only publish extensions that already exists on the store, so you will have to at least make a draft release for yourself, so the plugin can create a proper release for the first time. You can create a draft release with just a minimum `manifest.json` with version `0.0.1` compressed in a zip file.
If you decide to make the draft, make sure to fill all the required fields on the drafts page, otherwise the publish will fail with a `400` status code (Bad request).

#### `publish` parameters

- `extensionId`: **REQUIRED** parameter. The `extension id` from the webstore. For example: If the url of your extension is [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webplayer-hotkeys-shortcu/ikmkicnmahfdilneilgibeppbnolgkaf](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webplayer-hotkeys-shortcu/ikmkicnmahfdilneilgibeppbnolgkaf), then the last portion, `ikmkicnmahfdilneilgibeppbnolgkaf`, will be the `extension id`. You can also take this ID on the [developers dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard), under the name `Item ID` located inside the `More info` dialog.

- `asset`: **REQUIRED** parameter. The zip file that will be published to the chrome webstore.

- `target`: Valid options are:
  - `default`: The extension will be publicly available to everyone. This is the default option if left blank.
  - `draft`: Uploads the extension to the webstore, but skips the publishing step.
  - `trustedTesters`: Releases the extension as a [private extension](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/2663860). Defaults to `default`.

The `asset` parameter is parsed with Lodash template. The following variables are available: `branch`, `lastRelease`, `nextRelease` and `commits`. Search on the [plugins](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/developer-guide/plugin.md) documentation to see the type of those objects.

Example: `my-extension_v${nextRelease.version}_${branch.name}.zip` will result in something like `my-extension_v2.3.1_main.zip`

### Chrome webstore authentication

You will need to get three parameters from the Google API: a `clientId`, a `clientSecret` and a `refreshToken`. For more information on how to get those parameters and how to set the environment variables which are required in order for this plugin to work properly, read [this guide](Authentication.md).

### Release configs

Use `semantic-release-chrome` as part of `verifyConditions`, `prepare` and `publish`.

A basic configuration file example is available below:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "semantic-release-chrome",
      {
        "extensionId": "mppjhhbajcciljocgbadbhbgphjfdmhj",
        "asset": "my-extension.zip"
      }
    ],
    [
      "@semantic-release/github",
      {
        "assets": ["my-extension.zip"]
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

For more info about each config, see the parameters for each [plugin](#usage).

For more info on the configuration file, see the [configuration file][configuration-file] documentation on the [`semantic-release`][semantic-release] repository.
